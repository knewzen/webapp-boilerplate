## Getting Started

**Step 1.** Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.

**Step 2.** Clone this repository or use Yeoman generator to bootstrap your project:

```
$ git clone -o webapp-boilerplate -b master --single-branch \
      https://github.com/radum/webapp-boilerplate.git MyApp
$ cd MyApp
$ npm install                   # Install project dependencies listed in package.json
$ bower install                 # Install project dependencies listed in bower.json
```

**Step 3.** Compile and launch your app by running:

```
$ npm start                      # Same as `gulp serve`
```

This will fire up a local web server, open http://localhost:9000 in your default browser and watch files for changes, reloading the browser automatically via [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/).

## How to test

The unit tests are powered by chai and mocha.

```
$ gulp lint                     # Lint script files
$ gulp lint-css                 # Lint styles
$ gulp serve:test               # Run unit tests
```

## How to build a distribution

To make a production-ready build of the app, run:

```
$ gulp
$ gulp serve:dist               # To preview the production build
```

## Docs

For more information see the [docs](docs) folder.

### Run with Docker

If you don't want to install Node, npm and all its friends you can run this using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Build the docker image using `docker-compose`

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml build
```

Then run a container based on the previously created image

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up
```

This will start a docker container with the previously built image and it will run `npm run start`.

### Tasks

To get the list of available Gulp tasks, run:

```
$ gulp --tasks
```
